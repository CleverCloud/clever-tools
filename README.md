## Enabling autocompletion

The clever-tools CLI comes with a comprehensive auto-completion system. Some installation methods through package managers will try to enable it automatically. If not, use this for bash:

```bash
clever --bash-autocomplete-script $(which clever) | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/clever
```

or that for zsh:

```bash
clever --zsh-autocomplete-script $(which clever) | sudo tee /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
```

## How to use

You can then login and check everything is working:

```bash
clever login
clever profile
```
